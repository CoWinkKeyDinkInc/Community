# TODO List

Complete:
- [x] Reports
- [x] Username Cache
- [x] Moderation (SEE MOD TODO)

## Mod ToDo:
- [ ] Add alt lookup when joining (x has a similar IP to y)

## Major ToDo:
- [ ] Add ban import command
- [ ] Track player sessions (IP and last login date). Allows for `/seen` and `/alts` extensive lookups
- [ ] Teleports (/tp, /bring, consider CommandBook and what's used)
- [ ] MOTD login messages and unlimited "info" commands. Example, define rules section in config, command: 'rules', message: "etc" which would translate to `/rules` -> msg
- [ ] See if Freeze can be generalized (not a priority) 


## ToDo GitHub:
- [ ] Setup Wiki pages with Install, Commands, Permissions, Config pages
- [ ] Transfer TODO above to github projects and issues for each item, if not complete
- [ ] Finalize README with project info


## Bugs
- [ ] /msg is sending even when player is muted, look into PGM to fix this
