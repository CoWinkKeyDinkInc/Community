# Community
A plugin for managing a minecraft community

## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive yet simple way to manage players and provide useful features that just about every server could use. Community was designed to work with [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) in mind and is meant to be an official companion plugin. Though it will also operate perfectly fine on its own. This plugin will always be evolving and providing new features on a regular basis.

### Features
A number of useful features have been implemented:
- Moderation Commands (/ban, /kick, /warn, /mute)
- Player Reports
- Account tracking
- Friend Support
- Teleports
- Info commands & MOTD

## Governance
This project is maintained by [applenick](https://github.com/applenick), with assistance from [Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid) and other PGMDev developers.
